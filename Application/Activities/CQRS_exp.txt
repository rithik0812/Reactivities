CQRS separates the command operations to the Query operations : 

Query : expects some sort of response back 
(think GETALL and GETBYID)

Command : doesnt expect a response, but performs an operation behind the scenes 
(think CREATE DELETE UPDATE)

Using Mediator we can specify command vs query by changind the interface as follows : 

for Query : 
    public class Query : IRequest<ResponseType> { InputProps }

    public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Query, string> {...}

for Command : 
    public class Command : IRequest { InputProps }

    public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Command> {...}
