Using clean architecture we want our dependancy to go like : 

API (Handle Http requests) ==> Application (the logic (for example CRUD ops)) => Domain (the data model object) <= Persistence (so esentially the DB)

No dependency will flow the other direction 

We use the API layer to send requests to the Application layer that ineracts with the DBcontext and applies logic to the data. 

Since the Application cant depand on the API layer (ie. no imports ...)

We use mediator to send the responses for the requests back the API layer without depending on it. 

We use a IRequest interface to catch the request and an IHandler interface to apply logic and respond back to the API layer without any dependancy.

(note: we need to add mediator as a service in program.cs for the setup to work)
